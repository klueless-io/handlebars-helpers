## Stories

### Main Story

As a Ruby Developer, I want to use HandlebarsJS with useful helpers, so that I have a rich templating experience

See all [stories](./STORIES.md)

## Usage

See all [usage examples](./USAGE.md)

### Basic Example

#### Basic example

Description for a basic example to be featured in the main README.MD file

```ruby
class SomeRuby; end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

`handlebars-helpers` is setup with Guard, run `guard`, this will watch development file changes and run tests automatically, if successful, it will then run rubocop for style quality.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
